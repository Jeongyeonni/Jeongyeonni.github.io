## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Computational Clinical Science Laboratory at Seoul National University, Korea.
My research broadly focuses on understanding individual differences in neurocognitive processes that contribute to the onset and maintenance of psychiatric disorders. I am particularly interested in using computational and neuroscientific approaches to identify markers for early detection and prevention, and to develop rapid, reliable, and adaptive assessments that can be applied in both research and clinical settings. I am also interested in exploring how early life stress and other environmental factors influence these neurocognitive mechanisms across development.
