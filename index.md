## About Me

I am a master student at Computational Clinical Science Labaratory in Seoul National University, Korea. I'm broadly interested in the longitudinal impact of early life events, and the way of preventing negative impact. To achieve this goal, I hope to identify novel markers of psychiatric disorders and treatment oucoms by using neuroscientific approaches and computational methods.


## Research Interests

- **Preventive treatment:** neurocognitive markers, prediction of risk factors
- **Early Life Stress** risk/protective factors, longitudinal impact

## News

- **[Aug. 2023]** Our lab received R01 grant from NIH/NIDA.
